#+title: A minimal research setup for Emacs

* Idea

This is a specialized Emacs configuration for research, optimized for Linux virtual machines (tested with Fedora and Ubuntu). 

* Necessary command-line tools

For this setup to work properly you need to install git, ripgrep, fd, yt-dlp, mpv, and hunspell.

* How to

Install the necessary command-line tools. Then create a local folder such as ~\~/documents/GitHub/init~ and go to that directory. Then:

#+begin_src bash
git clone https://github.com/rtrppl/init.git
ln -s ~/documents/GitHub/init/init.el ~/.emacs
#+end_src
